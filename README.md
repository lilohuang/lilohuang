## 🛠️ Featured Open Source Project

### ⚡ [PyTurboJPEG](https://github.com/lilohuang/PyTurboJPEG)
A highly optimized Python wrapper for **libjpeg-turbo** (TurboJPEG API). 
* **Core Value:** Engineered for seamless, high-speed image transcoding across **x86** and **ARM** architectures.
* **Impact:** Widely used in computer vision pipelines where JPEG encoding/decoding is the primary bottleneck.

## 🏗️ Technical Focus & Contributions

I am actively involved in the ecosystem of high-performance libraries, with contributions and interests in:

* **GPU Computing:** Contributions to **NVIDIA/cccl** (CUDA Core Compute Libraries), **CuPy** (NumPy/SciPy for GPU), and **RAPIDS rmm**.
* **Systems Programming:** Experience with **libuv** (asynchronous I/O) and deep-learning performance optimization.
* **Computer Vision:** Optimizing end-to-end pipelines from raw sensor data to inference-ready tensors.
