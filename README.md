## 🛠️ Featured Open Source Project

### ⚡ [PyTurboJPEG](https://github.com/lilohuang/PyTurboJPEG)
A highly optimized Python wrapper for **libjpeg-turbo** (TurboJPEG API). 
* **Core Value:** Engineered for seamless, high-speed image transcoding across **x86** and **ARM** architectures.
* **Impact:** Widely used in computer vision pipelines where JPEG encoding/decoding is the primary bottleneck.
